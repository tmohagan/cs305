CS-305-H7967 Software Security 23EW1


Client: Artemis Financial

Artemis Financial is a company that wants to create a new online presence. They are concerned with security because money will be on the line.

Software Requirements

Artemis Financial needs a secure online platform that can handle financial transactions. The platform should be able to withstand attacks from malicious actors.

Identifying Software Security Vulnerabilities

I used a combination of static and dynamic analysis to identify software security vulnerabilities. Static analysis involves examining the code to identify potential problems. Dynamic analysis involves running the code and looking for vulnerabilities.

Importance of Coding Securely

Coding securely is important because it can help to prevent attacks. Attackers often look for vulnerabilities in software to exploit. By coding securely, you can make it more difficult for attackers to succeed.

Value of Software Security

Software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by reducing the risk of cyber attacks. Cyber attacks can be costly and damaging to a company's reputation.

Challenges and Helpful Aspects of the Vulnerability Assessment

One challenge I faced was that I had never performed a static analysis test myself before. However, I found this experience to be helpful. I also think that adding the ability to do dynamic testing would be useful.

Approaching the Need to Increase Layers of Security

To increase layers of security, I would start by never trusting input. This means sanitizing all input to prevent errant behaviors or worse. I would also use techniques such as encryption and authentication to protect data.

Future Techniques and Strategies for Assessing Vulnerabilities and Determining Mitigation Techniques

In the future, I would use the following techniques and strategies to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques:

Static and dynamic analysis
Threat modeling
Security reviews
Penetration testing
Resources, Tools, and Coding Practices

I employed the following resources, tools, and coding practices during this assignment:

Maven
Spring Boot
Java
Secure coding practices such as input validation and encryption
Showcasing Skills and Experience to a Future Employer

To showcase my skills and experience to a future employer, I would highlight the following from this assignment:

Building a Spring API that generates checksums
Using Maven to manage dependencies
Following secure coding practices
I believe that this assignment demonstrates my ability to develop secure and robust software applications.
